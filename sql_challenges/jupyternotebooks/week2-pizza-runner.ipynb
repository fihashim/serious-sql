    "Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza are devoured daily worldwide? This astounding statistic, coupled with Danny's serendipitous encounter with the phrase \"80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!\" on Instagram, sparked the inception of Pizza Runner. Recognizing that traditional pizza alone wouldn't suffice to propel his vision forward, Danny conceived the idea to \"Uberize\" pizza deliveryâ€”a concept that laid the foundation for Pizza Runner."
