# Serious SQL Data Apprenticeship
Created by [Danny Ma](https://www.datawithdanny.com/), the Serious SQL Data Apprenticeship is a structured SQL learning path combined with practical hands-on experience. Throughout this repository, end-to-end case studies and challenging data projects are solved from the following domains:

- Health analytics
- Marketing analytics
- People analytics
- Financial markets
- Fast moving consumer goods
- Digital marketing

The focus of this repository is to showcase my solutions (found in the [sql_challenges](https://github.com/fihashim/serious-sql/tree/main/sql_challenges) folder) to the 8 Week SQL Challenge where the problem statements and aims of each challenge are explained in the links below:
